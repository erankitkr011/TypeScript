At compiling time i dont want to create js file then i have to uncomment "noEmitOnError": true, in tsconfig.json file present on line 70.

tsc --init for tsconfig.json file

"rootDir": "./src", 
"outFile": "./js", 

"noImplicitAny": true, 



for refreshing we use tsc --watch
and nodemon for js file
